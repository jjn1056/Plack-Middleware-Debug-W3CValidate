## SYNOPSIS

    use Plack::Builder;

    builder {
        enable 'Debug::W3CValidate';
        $app;
    };

# DESCRIPTION

Adds a debug panel that runs your response body through the W3C validator and
returns a list of errors.

# OPTIONS

This debug panel defines the following options.

## validator_uri

Takes the url of the W3C validator.  Defaults to the common validator, but if
you plan to pound this it would be polite to setup your own and point to that
instead.  Please see [WebService::Validator::HTML::W3C](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?WebService::Validator::HTML::W3C) for more.
